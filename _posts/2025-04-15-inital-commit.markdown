Welcome to my first Post!

In this post i want to tell you what you can excpect from this blog.

The main inspiration behind this blog is to share my learnings. The idea is that by explaning the topics on my blog i find knwoledge gaps, deepen my understanding and maybe find someone who i can help. (And maybe get better in English)

I want to point out that im learning as well which means i might make mistakes and maybe overlook some things.

With that said i hope you enjoy my blog and im looking forward to future blog posts.
